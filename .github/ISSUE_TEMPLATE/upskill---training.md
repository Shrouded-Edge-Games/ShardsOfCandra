Description:
Basic understanding of this would include:
1.  
2.  
3.  

Commits to this issues should include an overview of the aspect you were working on (i.e. Particle Color Change On Velocity) and the description (if able) should make note of anything that you feel other folks would like to know or problems you ran into. (not something to stress about if you don't, just a time saver for other peeps)
